# Networking
There are ways to approach implementing a new network. 
The lifecycle approach to network design plans, prepares, implements, operates, and optimizes (PPDIOO). 
PPDIOO lowers the cost of network ownership, increases network availability, and applies quick access to applications and services. 
Network planning can take place on a whiteboard where the network planner shares ideas with their team
or a multi-departmental change control meeting to discuss 3-layer management.
